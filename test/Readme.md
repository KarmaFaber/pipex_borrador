# Test Directory Documentation

This directory contains scripts, outputs, and configurations for testing the `pipex` project. Below is an overview of its structure and how to utilize the provided resources.

## Directory Structure

```

## Prerequisites

Before running any tests, ensure that:
- The `pipex` executable is compiled and available in the project root.
- All scripts in `hs_files` have execution permissions. You can grant these permissions using:

  ```bash
  chmod +x test/hs_files/*.sh
  ```

- The necessary files like `infile` and `outfile` exist or are generated during the test process.

## Available Commands

### Makefile Targets

The `test` directory has its own `Makefile` that facilitates testing. The following commands are available:


- **`make norm`**
  - Runs the `norminette` check on the project and test scripts.

	```bash
	make norm
	```

- **`make test`**
  - more typical cases (included in the subject) + slightly more specific cases
  	```bash
	make test
	```

- **`make test_all`**
  - Runs all tests, including norm checks, valgrind, and sanitizers.
  	```bash
	make test_all
	```

- **`make valgrind`**
  - Executes the `pipex` program under valgrind to check for memory leaks.
  	```bash
	make valgrind
	```

- **`make san_all`**
  - Compiles and runs the project with all supported sanitizers:
    - AddressSanitizer
    - UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
    - LeakSanitizer
    - ThreadSanitizer
  	```bash
	make san_all
	```

- **Sanitizer-specific targets**:
  - `make run_asan`: Runs with AddressSanitizer.
  - `make run_usan`: Runs with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
  - `make run_lsan`: Runs with LeakSanitizer.
  - `make run_tsan`: Runs with ThreadSanitizer.

- **Cleanup Targets**
This commands will ask the user if he/she wants to delete temporary files: 
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Are you sure you want to delete all test stats? (y/n).

üõë Warning: Are you sure you want to delete all Valgrind log files? (y/n)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Are you sure you want to delete all test stats? (y/n)


  - `make clean_test`: Cleans test-related files such as `infile`, `outfile`, and temporary files. 
  - `make clean_valgrind`: Deletes all valgrind logs. 
  - `make fclean_test`: Performs a full cleanup of compiled files of proyect and cleans test-related files such as `infile`, `outfile`, and temporary files.. 
  - `make fclean_all`: Performs a full cleanup of test and compiled files of proyect. 

## Testing Workflow

1. **Setup**:
   Ensure `pipex` is compiled by running:
   ```bash
   make -C ../
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   Execute the desired test target. For example:
   ```bash
   make test
   make valgrind
   ```

3. **Review Results**:
   Check the output files in the `test_outputs` directory and valgrind logs in `valgrind_outputs`.

4. **Cleanup**:

   -Remove temporary **all** files: fclean (libft + pipex) + clean_test + clean_valgrind
   ```bash
   make fclean_all
   ```
   -Remove temporary test files and proyect object files: fclean (libft + pipex) + clean_test 
   ```bash
   make fclean_test
   ```

   -Remove temporary **test** files using:
   ```bash
   make clean_test
   ```

   -Remove temporary **Vangrind** files using:
   ```bash
   make clean_valgrind
   ```

## Notes

- Modify `commands.txt` and `special_cases.sh` to include any additional test cases specific to your implementation.
- Review `commands.txt` for a list of standard commands used during testing and `special_cases.sh` for special cases.
